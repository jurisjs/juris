# Juris

**JavaScript Unified Reactive Interface Solution**

Transforms web development through its comprehensive object-first architecture that makes reactivity an intentional choice rather than an automatic behavior. By expressing interfaces as pure JavaScript objects where functions explicitly define reactivity, Juris delivers a complete solution for applications that are universally deployable, precisely controlled, and designed from the ground up for seamless AI collaboration—all while maintaining the simplicity and debuggability of native JavaScript patterns.

## Features

- **Object-First Architecture**: Express interfaces as pure JavaScript objects
- **Intentional Reactivity**: Functions explicitly define reactive behavior
- **Universal Deployment**: Works across all JavaScript environments
- **AI Collaboration Ready**: Designed for seamless AI integration
- **Native JavaScript Patterns**: Maintains simplicity and debuggability
- **Precise Control**: Fine-grained control over reactive behaviors
